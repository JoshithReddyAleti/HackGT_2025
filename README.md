# TaskForceAI

A generative AI-powered healthcare copilot built at HackGT!

---

## üöë Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals are drowning in EMR screens, insurance confusion, and notification overload. Critical insights and evidence get buried, workflows get messy, and burnout is real. Providers need *clarity, context, and more time for patients*‚Äînot just more data.

---

## üåü Solution Overview

TaskForceAI is an ecosystem of 7 intelligent, orchestrated AI agents that deliver clinical, cost, and research context‚Äîauto-magically and on demand.  
Built with:
- **Impiricus** (clinical + billing brain)
- **CedarOS** (agentic, modern interface)
- **Mastra/Ergo** (agent orchestration engine)

## üß† Agent Functionalities (What Each Agent Does)

| Agent Name             | Functionality |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Questionnaire Agent**| Collects patient intake, pre-visit data, preferences |
| **EMR Agent**          | Parses and summarizes full patient EMR: demographics, history, diagnoses, allergies, meds, labs, health trends |
| **Payer Agent**        | Retrieves payer, coverage, cost estimate, prior-auth status, real-time billing clarity |
| **Notifier Agent**     | Surfaces only the most critical alerts, fighting alert fatigue |
| **Evidence Agent**     | Finds and summarizes the latest clinical studies and guidance for any given scenario |
| **SummaryGen Agent**   | Auto-creates complete visit/clinical briefings with EMR, payer, evidence, and trends when appointments are booked |
| **StarterAgent**       | Main orchestrator‚Äîroutes user queries, triggers agent workflows, and answers on demand |

## üìë Data & Mock Integration

We integrated and showcased **2500 test patients** with real clinical structure from Mocarro & Kaggle:
- Preprocessed in Python: handled missing (NAN) values, normalized fields
- Key fields used:  
  - `patient_id, age, gender, specialty, chief_complaint, symptoms, diagnoses, medications, lab_results, allergies, insurance details, intake preferences`
- This rich dataset allows instant agent demo for:
  - EMR chart review
  - Insurance/cost workflow
  - Real-time evidence
  - Longitudinal (multi-visit) tracking
